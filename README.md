# OOP_Pillars
### Created Object Oriented Concepts

## Includes
- Inheritance (Classes, Objects, Instance variables and methods, etc)

- Encapsulation (Data Hiding)

- Polymorphism (Interface, method overloading and method overriding)

- Abstraction (Interface abstract methods)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Created a Person class that has a parameterized constructor to make objects. 

2. Created 2 classes Employee and Student as subclasses of the Person  class as a super class.

3. Created objects for the 2 subclasses mentioned above, took the input from the user.

4. Created another class as Person1 and declare private properties in it. Also created setter and getter methods in this class as public methods.

5. To test encapsulation created objects for this class with the user input values.

6. Created an Interface PersonInterface. Declared one static final variable for the organization name and created 2 abstract methods in it. One calculates an int argument and returns a double value. The other method is highScore that returns a double value.
